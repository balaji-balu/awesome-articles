FURPS+ : 
FURPS is an acronym representing a model for classifying software quality attributes (functional and non-functional requirements):

- **Functionality** - Capability (Size & Generality of Feature Set), Reusability (Compatibility, Interoperability, Portability), Security (Safety & Exploitability)

- **Usability** (UX) - Human Factors, Aesthetics, Consistency, Documentation, Responsiveness

- **Reliability** - Availability (Failure Frequency (Robustness/Durability/Resilience), Failure Extent & Time-Length (Recoverability/Survivability)), Predictability (Stability), Accuracy (Frequency/Severity of Error)

- **Performance** - Speed, Efficiency, Resource Consumption (power, ram, cache, etc.), Throughput, Capacity, Scalability

- **Supportability** (Serviceability, Maintainability, Sustainability, Repair Speed) - Testability, Flexibility (Modifiability, Configurability, Adaptability, Extensibility, Modularity), Installability, Localizability

Cross functional requirements:
- sometimes called as Non-functional requirements
- also called as architecture drivers
- quality attributes (in software architecture in practice book)

[Refactoring Databases](), Book
- is a simple change to a database schema that improves its design while retaining both its behavioral and informational semantics. 
- In other words you cannot add new functionality or break exisiting functionality nor can you add new data or change the meaning of existing data. 
- a database schema includes both structural aspects, such as table and view definitions, and functional aspects, such as stored procedures and triggers.
- 
k8s, [init containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/) : specialized containers that run before app containers in a Pod. Init containers can contain utilities or setup scripts not present in an app image.

Working in Small Batches
- part of [Devops Process capabilities](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-process-working-in-small-batches)
- Small batches permit us to deliver results faster, with higher quality and less stress.
- [faster feedback](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2945077) is the biggest win 
- architecture, code, database: all together deployed as single unit 
- encourages experimentation
- ci, cd pipelines support small batches approach
- refactoring databases in small batches: small and simple change
- easy to undo changes 
- supports evolutionary architecture thinking
- Select small stories, implement, deploy, test fast

However, in the process we have hit very familiar ‚Äòmedium sized‚Äô scale problems which caused us to migrate our services out of my basement. This is the outage report, post mortem, and high level overview of the process of migrating to Hetzner in Germany. From observation to production fixes. This is the story.
