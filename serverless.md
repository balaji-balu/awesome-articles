Concerns:
- Event programming model
- monolithic lambda (use microservices and SAM for deploying as a single unit)
- reducing the time of execution
- resources: cpu, memory
- Concurrency:
-- reservered and provisional concurrency
- timeout, tuning for concurrency 
- idempotent 
- observability: monitoring, tracing, logging and metrics
- deploying using cicd
- Testing
- separate aws account for developer testing
